# Capstone
MovieLens Capstone_Project is part of Harvard PH125.9 course.

DataSet
This project is based on 'MovieLens' dataset which will be used to create a recommender system. The dataset is available at below location:

- [MovieLens 10M dataset] https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/10m/

- [MovieLens 10M dataset - zip file] http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-10m.zip

Target
The target is to develop a machine learning algorithm that takes input from provided training subset and predict movie ratings on validation dataset.

The focus is on RMSE of the algorithm which will be used to evaluate as how close movie predictions are to the true values in the validation set.

Key Steps
In this project, we have used the 10M records version of Movielens dataset. Major steps for this project is detailed as below:  

* Load the data and do initial exploration  
* Insight analysis and vizualization  
* Build 4 models based on the `edx` dataset   
* Validate the final model by computing RMSEs for `validation` dataset.
